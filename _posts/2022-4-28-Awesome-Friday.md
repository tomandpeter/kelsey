A few months ago, I had the best friday at school ever! That friday we had no classes at all. We had a ton of school festivals. Everyone enjoyed that day the same as I did.

First, we went to the playgroud and I saw the whole school there! Then we listened to a presentation about the first day fo the PE festival.

Second,we took a tour of the whole school. In our tour, we saw the junior and senior high school. We almost walked into another building! Finally the most exciting part happened! We walked to the playground again and then went to the stage. We all sat on the stage and we all cheered for the compitition. In the competition there was even some of my classmates.

And that was the best day ever.
